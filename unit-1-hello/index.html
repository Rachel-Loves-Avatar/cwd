    <span style="font-family:'Chewy', system-ui;"><p class="Text1">Splatoon is a video game series created by Nintendo in 2015. You play as an inkling (or an octoling) who, with your team, has to cover most of a stage with your ink color before time runs out. Whoever covers the stage with their color the most wins!</p>

    <p class="Text2">There are three mainline games and two DLCs: Octo Expansion and Side Order. There is also an upcoming spinoff game called "Splatoon Raiders".</p>
